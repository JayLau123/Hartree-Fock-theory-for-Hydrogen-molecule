# Hartree-Fock-theory-for-Hydrogen

Replaced the exact N-body wave function of the system with a single Slater determinant in time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation.

Used Hartree-Fock theory to build a numerical model for hydrogen with 6-31G basis from Basis Set Exchange and solved the equation using a nonlinear method and self-consistent field method.

Solved the physical quantities matrix model with Born-Oppenheimer Approximation, and the quantitive relation of total energy and bond distance of a single molecule.
