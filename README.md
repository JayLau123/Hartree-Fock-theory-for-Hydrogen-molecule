### The Materials Project

**by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory**

https://materialsproject.org/

The database contains over 1M computed properties based on DFT and HPC. But most of them are calculated by cheap and not very accurate methods

Introduction: Harnessing the power of supercomputing and state-of-the-art methods, the Materials Project provides open web-based access to computed information on known and predicted materials as well as powerful analysis tools to inspire and design novel materials.



### Hartree-Fock-theory-for-Hydrogen

Replaced the exact N-body wave function of the system with a single Slater determinant in time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation.

Used Hartree-Fock theory to build a numerical model for hydrogen with 6-31G basis from Basis Set Exchange and solved the equation using a nonlinear method and self-consistent field method.

Solved the physical quantities matrix model with Born-Oppenheimer Approximation, and the quantitive relation of total energy and bond distance of a single molecule.
